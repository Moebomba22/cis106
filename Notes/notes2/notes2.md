## Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes

##### What is an Operating System?
An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

##### What is a kernel? 
The kernel is the core component of an operating system, responsible for managing system resources and communication between hardware and software.

##### Which other parts aside from the kernel identify an OS? 
Aside from the kernel, an OS includes system libraries, user interfaces, system utilities, and application programming interfaces (APIs).

##### What is Linux? 
Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, known for its stability and flexibility.

##### What is a Linux distribution?
 A Linux distribution (distro) is a packaged version of the Linux operating system that includes the Linux kernel, system libraries, and additional software tailored for specific needs or users.

##### List at least 4 Linux characteristics:
Open Source: Source code is freely available for modification and redistribution.
Multitasking: Supports multiple processes running simultaneously.
Portability: Can run on various hardware platforms.
Security: Strong user permission model and regular updates enhance security.

##### What is Ubuntu? 
Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution based on Debian, designed for ease of use, with a focus on user-friendliness and community support.

##### What is Debian? 
Debian is a stable and versatile Linux distribution known for its robustness and extensive software repositories, often serving as the basis for other distributions like Ubuntu.

##### List and define the different types of licensing agreements:
Proprietary License: Software is owned by an individual or company; users cannot modify or distribute it.
Open Source License: Allows users to view, modify, and distribute the source code (e.g., GPL, MIT).
Freeware License: Software is free to use but not open source; users cannot modify or share it.

##### What is Free Software? 
Define the 4 freedoms. Free software is software that respects users' freedom. The four freedoms are:
Freedom to run the program: Users can run the software for any purpose.
Freedom to study and change the program: Users can examine and modify the source code.
Freedom to redistribute copies: Users can share the software with others.
Freedom to distribute modified versions: Users can share their modifications with others.

##### What is virtualization? 
Virtualization is the creation of virtual (rather than actual) versions of computing resources, such as servers, storage devices, or network resources.

##### List 3 benefits of virtualization:
Resource Efficiency: Better utilization of hardware resources.
Isolation: Virtual machines run independently, reducing the risk of system conflicts.
Scalability: Easily add or remove virtual machines as needed.

##### What is a hypervisor?
 ###### Include definitions of the 2 types. A hypervisor is software that creates and manages virtual machines. The two types are:
Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal): Runs directly on the hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V).
Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted): Runs on top of an existing operating system (e.g., VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox).

##### What is the difference between Guest OS and Host OS?
###### Host OS: The operating system that runs on the physical hardware and manages the hypervisor.
###### Guest OS: The operating system that runs within a virtual machine created by the hypervisor.

##### What is VirtualBox? 
VirtualBox is an open-source virtualization software that allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. It supports various guest operating systems and provides features like snapshots and shared folders.
