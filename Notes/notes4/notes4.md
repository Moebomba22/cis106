## Definition of The Following Terms:
#### File System

* A file system is a method and data structure that an operating system uses to manage files on a disk or partition. It controls how data is stored and retrieved, managing file hierarchy, permissions, and directories. Examples of file systems include FAT32, Windows, Linux, and Mac.
#### 2. Pathname

* A pathname is the address or location of a file or directory in the file system. It specifies the route that must be taken to reach a file or directory, either relative to the current directory or as an absolute path starting from the root directory.
#### 3. Absolute Path

* An absolute path specifies the full path to a file or directory, starting from the root (/) directory, regardless of the current working directory. It always begins with a /.

    * Example: /home/user/Documents/file.txt

#### 4. Relative Path

* A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory. It does not begin with a / and depends on where you are in the directory structure.

    * Example (assuming current directory is /home/user):
    Documents/file.txt refers to the file.txt inside the Documents folder within the current directory.

#### 5. The Difference Between "Your Home Directory" and "The Home Directory"

    * Your Home Directory: This is a personal directory assigned to a user when they log into a system. For example, if your username is student, your home directory might be /home/student.
    * The Home Directory: This generally refers to the /home directory where all user home directories are stored (e.g., /home/student, /home/user2, etc.). It's the parent directory of individual user home directories.

#### 6. Parent Directory

* A parent directory is the directory that contains the current directory (also called the working directory). Every directory, except the root (/), has a parent directory. You can move to the parent directory using cd ...

    * Example: The parent directory of /home/student/Documents is /home/student.

#### 7. Child Directory or Subdirectory

* A child directory (or subdirectory) is a directory that is contained within another directory (its parent directory). It's part of the hierarchical structure of a file system.

    * Example: If /home/student/Documents is the parent directory, then /home/student/Documents/Work is a child directory of Documents.

#### 8. Bash Special Characters

* In Bash, special characters have special meanings and are used to control various aspects of the shell or to perform specific tasks. Some examples include:

    * $ (dollar sign): Used to reference variables.
    ~(tilde): Refers to the home directory.
    / (slash): Used to separate directory names in a path.
    . (dot): Refers to the current directory.
    .. (double dot): Refers to the parent directory.
    | (pipe): Redirects the output of one command to the input of another.
    * > (greater than): Redirects output to a file.
    * (asterisk): Wildcard that matches any string of characters.

#### 9. Environment Variables

* Environment variables are dynamic variables in the shell that affect how processes behave on the system. They hold system-wide information and settings, such as paths to system directories or configuration options. Examples include PATH, HOME, USER, and SHELL.

    * Example: echo $HOME outputs the path to the current user's home directory.

#### 10. User-Defined Variables

* User-defined variables are custom variables that users create during a session or in a script to store data. They can hold strings, numbers, or other types of information. These variables can be used to simplify and automate shell scripting tasks.
